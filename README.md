## About Schiavinato Sharing

**In one line:** Schiavinato Sharing lets you split a standard **BIP39** recovery phrase into **k-of-n** durable, human-readable backup shares, with optional **per-share audit** before recovery. The normal experience is **offline, software-assisted sharing and recovery**; the same core math can also be executed fully manually when software is unavailable or untrusted.

### Problem

Self-custody often depends on one recovery phrase. If it is lost, funds may be gone forever; if it is exposed, funds may be stolen. A good backup needs more than secrecy: it should survive missing people, damaged papers, copying mistakes, unavailable devices, expired subscriptions, unavailable services, and future recovery by someone who may not have the original setup.

Schiavinato Sharing focuses on **cold storage and disaster recovery** for an existing BIP39 phrase. It is meant for people, families, businesses, advisors, and organizations that want threshold backup without permanently depending on one app, hardware vendor, custodian, paid subscription, hosted recovery service, software implementation, or custom share alphabet.

### What Schiavinato Sharing is

At the technical layer, Schiavinato Sharing is a **Shamir-style** secret sharing scheme applied directly to the words of a valid BIP39 mnemonic. Each word is treated as its **1-based index** in the BIP39 word list (`abandon` = 1, `zoo` = 2048), and the sharing math runs modulo **2053**, the smallest prime larger than the word list.

Any **k** of **n** shares reconstruct the original mnemonic. Fewer than **k** shares reveal no information about it, under the standard information-theoretic secrecy claim of Shamir sharing. The optional **BIP39 passphrase** ("25th word") is **NOT** stored in the shares and must be backed up and re-entered separately if you use one.

In practice, the protocol is **software-assisted first**. In the normal path, an offline tool handles the arithmetic, guides both the sharing ceremony and the recovery workflow, validates intermediate checks, and produces printable or hand-transcribable artifacts. The intended reference path is a single PGP-verified HTML file that can run locally on an air-gapped computer; high-assurance ceremonies can run it from a [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org/) USB session.

### Why Manual Fallback Matters

Manual fallback is not the recommended everyday workflow. It is the sovereignty backstop.

The software should make sharing and recovery easier, faster, and less error-prone. But a backup meant for serious self-custody should not become useless just because the original app is gone, a vendor disappears, a subscription lapses, a hosted service shuts down, an app store is blocked, an operating system changes, or the recovery happens years later in a constrained environment. Schiavinato Sharing keeps the software-assisted workflow practical while keeping the arithmetic readable from durable artifacts such as paper, metal, or other long-lived media.

The same shares can be generated or recovered using paper tables, a basic calculator, modular arithmetic, and precomputed Lagrange coefficients. In other words: use software when you can; keep the paper path specified for when you cannot.

### Why Per-Share Audit Matters

Long-term, geographically distributed backups should be checkable before the day they are needed. Schiavinato Sharing defines a separate **Share Audit Ceremony**: one physical share can be audited at a time, wherever it is stored, without gathering a threshold set, combining shares, or exposing the mnemonic. In many backup systems, a meaningful audit effectively becomes a recovery drill: enough shares must be brought together to reconstruct or nearly reconstruct the secret, increasing coordination burden and creating an unnecessary exposure event. Here, audit and recovery are separate operations.

In the manual path, public row/column/GIC checks detect passive damage or transcription errors, while optional MAT tags can authenticate the word rows against separately stored Manifest key material. In the software-assisted path, Full and Compact payloads plus Manifest Audit Hashes add computational checks when a separate Manifest is available. The result is a practical pre-recovery audit: each custodian artifact can be inspected periodically without turning an audit drill into a recovery ceremony.

### Who This Is For

Schiavinato Sharing is for people and organizations that want threshold backup of an existing BIP39 phrase without turning one vendor, device, custodian, subscription, hosted service, or software stack into a permanent dependency. Common use cases include:

- **Security-conscious self-custodians** who want a smoother way to split and later recover a seed without locking themselves into a proprietary backup format.
- **Individuals and families** setting up backup, succession, or inheritance plans where recovery may involve relatives, heirs, or trusted advisors.
- **Businesses, family offices, and Bitcoin treasury holders** that need durable backup for seed material, whether the spending setup uses single-sig, multisig, dedicated hardware wallets, or a combination of custody controls.
- **Professional advisors and service providers** helping clients run self-custody ceremonies while keeping the advisor out of the secret-handling path.
- **Non-Governmental Organizations, civil-society groups, journalists, activists, and human-rights defenders** that hold Bitcoin across people or jurisdictions and need recovery arrangements that do not rely on a single account, app store, vendor, or country.
- **Cross-border custody arrangements** where shares are held in different locations and recovery should remain possible even when travel, infrastructure, or access to specific services is disrupted.

### What it does and how

- **Threshold backup:** Split one BIP39 phrase into **n** shares and choose how many are needed to recover it. Typical examples are 2-of-3, 2-of-4, or 3-of-5.
- **Human-readable shares:** A share is a table of numbers and word indices with checksums, optionally paired with a QR payload for software-assisted validation. A separate optional manifest can track the shares, their destinations, and audit fingerprints without containing the mnemonic or plaintext share contents.
- **Offline-first workflow:** The recommended ceremony uses an air-gapped tool to do the error-prone arithmetic, guide the user, create share tables, and optionally produce QR payloads and manifests.
- **Full manual path:** The same protocol can be executed without software: shares can be **created** and later **recovered** with paper tables, modular arithmetic, random coefficients, checksums, and precomputed Lagrange coefficients. Software is helpful, not mandatory forever.
- **Error detection:** Row checksums, column checksums, and a **Global Integrity Check** help catch arithmetic mistakes, transcription errors, damaged entries, and wrong share labels before they silently become a bad recovery.
- **Output profiles:** Full serializes the complete canonical arithmetic table and includes a Transport Hash. Compact serializes word shares only, reducing QR size and hand-transcription burden while checking against the printed table.
- **Per-share audit:** One physical share can be checked before recovery without combining it with other shares. Public row/column/GIC checks catch passive corruption, optional MAT tags provide bounded manual substitution detection, and a separately stored Manifest Audit Hash can commit to each share payload.
- **Post-recovery validation:** After recovery, software can check the BIP39 checksum, compare the protocol-input-bound **Recovery Binding Tag (RBT)**, and optionally compare a truncated **Recovery Verification Address (RVA)** re-derived offline from the intended wallet setup.
- **Nested custody:** A share can itself be shared again, enabling layered arrangements such as family, business, trustee, or inheritance structures. Full supports up to **four active layers** and Compact up to **two active layers**, while single-layer sharing remains the baseline workflow.
- **Output choices:** The protocol distinguishes printer trust levels, so secret-bearing material is only sent to devices appropriate for the ceremony. When printing is not trusted or not available, users can hand-transcribe the share tables and, where used, copy or paint the QR grids by hand.
- **Pause and resume:** Longer software-assisted ceremonies can be paused and resumed with encrypted resume artifacts. A companion app may help store or transport those encrypted artifacts and non-secret print materials without seeing the mnemonic, plaintext shares, coefficients, or recovery secret.

### What it is not

- **Not** multisig, MPC, or a spending policy. It protects recovery material; it does not decide who may sign transactions.
- **Not** protection against every real-world threat. Physical security, custodian selection, ceremony hygiene, and malware resistance still matter.
- **Not** magic against **k or more compromised shares**. If enough valid shares are exposed, the mnemonic can be recovered.
- **Not** authentication by checksums alone. A malicious party who can rewrite a whole share may also recompute its arithmetic checks; substitution detection comes from custody practice, manifests, identity checks, and wallet-context checks where used.
- **Not** audited production cryptography; treat as **experimental**.

### Comparison with related approaches

MPC wallets, on-chain multisig, and social-recovery contracts mostly answer **who may spend** and **under what online policy**. Schiavinato Sharing answers a narrower backup question: how to split an **existing BIP39 mnemonic** into durable threshold shares, optionally audit one share at a time, and later recover the **same standard mnemonic** ordinary wallets already import—with a software-assisted path and a fully manual path.

**Manual-capable mnemonic backup schemes**

Codex32 uses BCH codes and paper aids such as volvelles and tables. It provides strong manual error handling, but it does not round-trip a standard BIP39 mnemonic. SeedXOR is deliberately minimal: XOR splitting has a simple mental model and BIP39-shaped output, but it is n-of-n only and offers little structured detection when something is wrong.

| Feature | Schiavinato | Codex32 | SeedXOR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary scope | BIP39 | Bitcoin/BIP32 only | BIP39 |
| Threshold flexibility | Full *k-of-n* | *k-of-n* (k<=9, n<=31) | *n-of-n* only |
| Manual procedure | Integer arithmetic mod 2053 | BCH + volvelles/tables | XOR |
| Error handling | Detection (*d*=4 linear layer) | Correction (BCH) | Weak / none |
| Per-share pre-recovery check | Yes (a) | Error detection only | No |
| Post-recovery verification | BIP39 + RBT + optional RVA (b) | Not BIP39-native output | BIP39 only |
| BIP39 round-trip | Native I/O | No | Yes |
| Share representation | Paper table + optional QR | Custom bech32 strings | BIP39 words |
| Recursive composition | Yes | Flat | Flat |

**(a)** Public row/column/GIC checks validate passive consistency; optional MAT adds manual pre-recovery substitution detection; Manifest Audit Hashes add computational commitment checks when a separate Manifest is available. **(b)** RBT binds the recovered protocol object to the original session; RVA is a truncated wallet witness recorded at setup and re-derived after recovery.

**Software-oriented threshold schemes**

SLIP39 and SSKR are built for software-led recovery. Both use sound finite-field sharing, but neither specifies a plain pencil-and-paper prime-field path for the full ceremony. SLIP39 uses a different derivation model than BIP39, so the same underlying material does not restore the same wallet as a normal BIP39 mnemonic. SSKR preserves BIP39 round-trip behavior by operating on raw entropy and packaging shares as Bytewords or UR; recovery still assumes the decoding stack is available.

| Feature | Schiavinato | SLIP39 | SSKR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arithmetic domain | Prime GF(2053) | GF(2^8) + RS1024 checksum | Extension GF(2^8) |
| Wallet compatibility | Native BIP39 | Different derivation (a) | BIP39 round-trip via raw entropy (b) |
| Share encoding | Table + optional QR | Custom 20-word encoding | Bytewords / UR |
| Per-share pre-recovery check | Yes (c) | Share checksum only | Share checksum only |
| Post-recovery verification | BIP39 + RBT + RVA (d) | Reconstruction digest in polynomial (e) | BIP39 checksum |
| Non-software path | Yes, sharing and recovery | No | No |
| Manual arithmetic | Integer mod 2053 | No | No |

**(a)** SLIP39 restoration does not reproduce a standard BIP39 wallet from the same encoded material. **(b)** SSKR preserves the usual BIP39 seed when round-tripped through its documented encodings; the share transport is not aimed at hand evaluation of GF arithmetic. **(c)** Public consistency checks, optional MAT, and Manifest Audit Hashes support single-share verification without recombination. **(d)** RBT tests the recovered protocol object; RVA tests the intended wallet context, including derivation and optional passphrase. **(e)** SLIP39 embeds a four-byte reconstruction digest in the polynomial so the reconstructed master secret self-checks.

## Implementations
Prototype implementations are work in progress and may lag the current specification. They are useful for experimentation and review, but should not be treated as conformant until each repository explicitly declares support for the current spec and vectors:
- **HTML (single-file, air-gapped)**: [`schiavinato-sharing-html`](https://github.com/GRIFORTIS/schiavinato-sharing-html)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: [`schiavinato-sharing-js`](https://github.com/GRIFORTIS/schiavinato-sharing-js)
- **Python**: [`schiavinato-sharing-py`](https://github.com/GRIFORTIS/schiavinato-sharing-py)

**Deployment note:** For higher-assurance ceremonies, the single-file HTML tool can be verified by PGP signature, loaded from a USB stick, and run in a [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org/) session on a laptop with networking disabled. Shares are then printed or hand-transcribed according to the chosen printer-trust tier.
