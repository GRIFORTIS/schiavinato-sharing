# Proposals

This directory contains proposals for changes to Schiavinato Sharing.

## Purpose
- **Proposals** are the decision record: motivation, trade-offs, compatibility, and acceptance/rejection.
- **Specs** are the normative text: `manual_spec/` and `software_spec/`.

## Labels
Every proposal MUST declare its scope:
- **[spec]**: specification-only change
- **[code]**: implementation-only change (no spec change)
- **[both]**: spec + implementation change

And its target:
- **manual_spec**
- **software_spec**
- **both**

## Lifecycle
Draft → Review → Accepted/Rejected → Implemented → Released

## Files
- `0000-template.md`: proposal template
